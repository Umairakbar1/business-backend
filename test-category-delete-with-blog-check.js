console.log("üîß ENHANCED: Category and Subcategory Delete Functions");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/categories/:id");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/subcategories/:id");
console.log("‚úÖ BLOG USAGE CHECK ADDED: Now checks for blog usage before deletion!");

console.log("\nüö® PROBLEM THAT WAS SOLVED:");
console.log("‚ùå BEFORE: Categories/subcategories could be deleted even if used in blogs");
console.log("‚ùå BEFORE: No validation for blog usage");
console.log("‚ùå BEFORE: Could cause data integrity issues");
console.log("‚ùå BEFORE: No information about usage count");

console.log("\n‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:");
console.log("‚úÖ AFTER: Checks for blog usage before deletion");
console.log("‚úÖ AFTER: Provides detailed error messages with usage counts");
console.log("‚úÖ AFTER: Prevents data integrity issues");
console.log("‚úÖ AFTER: Shows exactly how many blogs are using the category/subcategory");

console.log("\nüìä HOW IT WORKS NOW:");

console.log("\n1. Category Delete Process:");
console.log("   Step 1: Check if category exists");
console.log("   Step 2: Check if category has subcategories");
console.log("   Step 3: Check if category is used by businesses");
console.log("   Step 4: Check if category is used by blogs");
console.log("   Step 5: If all checks pass, delete category");

console.log("\n2. Subcategory Delete Process:");
console.log("   Step 1: Check if subcategory exists");
console.log("   Step 2: Check if subcategory is used by businesses");
console.log("   Step 3: Check if subcategory is used by blogs");
console.log("   Step 4: If all checks pass, delete subcategory");

console.log("\n3. Error Response Structure:");
console.log("   - success: false");
console.log("   - message: Detailed error message with usage count");
console.log("   - code: '00400' (Bad Request)");
console.log("   - data: { blogCount: number } or { businessCount: number }");

console.log("\nüîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:");

console.log("\n1. Category Delete Check:");
console.log("   const blogCount = await Blog.countDocuments({ category: id });");
console.log("   if (blogCount > 0) {");
console.log("     return errorResponseHelper(res, {");
console.log("       message: `Cannot delete category because it is linked to ${blogCount} blog(s)...`,");
console.log("       code: '00400',");
console.log("       data: { blogCount }");

console.log("   if (blogCount > 0) {");
console.log("     return errorResponseHelper(res, {");
console.log("       message: `Cannot delete subcategory because it is linked to ${blogCount} blog(s)...`,");
console.log("       code: '00400',");
console.log("       data: { blogCount }");
console.log("     });");
console.log("   }");

console.log("\nüìù USAGE EXAMPLES:");

console.log("\n// Try to delete category with blogs");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/categories/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0");
console.log("Response: Cannot delete category because it is linked to 3 blog(s)");

console.log("\n// Try to delete category with businesses");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/categories/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d1");
console.log("Response: Cannot delete category because it is linked to 5 business(es)");

console.log("\n// Try to delete subcategory with blogs");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/subcategories/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d4");
console.log("Response: Cannot delete subcategory because it is linked to 2 blog(s)");

console.log("\n// Successfully delete category/subcategory");
console.log("DELETE /api/admin/categories/64f8a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d3");
console.log("Response: Category deleted successfully");

console.log("\nüéØ BENEFITS OF THE ENHANCEMENT:");

console.log("\n‚úÖ Data Integrity:");
console.log("   - Prevents deletion of categories/subcategories in use");
console.log("   - Maintains referential integrity");
console.log("   - No orphaned references");

console.log("\n‚úÖ User Experience:");
console.log("   - Clear error messages with usage counts");
console.log("   - Helps users understand why deletion failed");
console.log("   - Suggests alternative actions (archive instead)");

console.log("\n‚úÖ System Reliability:");
console.log("   - Prevents system errors from broken references");
console.log("   - Maintains data consistency");
console.log("   - Better error handling");

console.log("\n‚úÖ Administrative Control:");
console.log("   - Admins know exactly what's using the category/subcategory");
console.log("   - Can make informed decisions about data management");
console.log("   - Better audit trail");

console.log("\nüîç TESTING THE ENHANCEMENT:");

console.log("\nTo test this enhancement, you can:");

console.log("\n1. Create test data:");
console.log("   - Create a category");
console.log("   - Create a subcategory");
console.log("   - Create blogs using the category and subcategory");
console.log("   - Create businesses using the category and subcategory");

console.log("\n2. Test category deletion:");
console.log("   - Try to delete category with blogs ‚Üí Should fail with blog count");
console.log("   - Try to delete category with businesses ‚Üí Should fail with business count");
console.log("   - Try to delete category with subcategories ‚Üí Should fail");
console.log("   - Try to delete unused category ‚Üí Should succeed");

console.log("\n3. Test subcategory deletion:");
console.log("   - Try to delete subcategory with blogs ‚Üí Should fail with blog count");
console.log("   - Try to delete subcategory with businesses ‚Üí Should fail with business count");
console.log("   - Try to delete unused subcategory ‚Üí Should succeed");

console.log("\n4. Verify error responses:");
console.log("   - Check that error messages include usage counts");
console.log("   - Verify that data field contains the count");
console.log("   - Ensure proper HTTP status codes");

console.log("\n‚úÖ The blog usage check is now fully implemented!");
console.log("‚úÖ Categories and subcategories are protected from deletion when in use!");
console.log("‚úÖ Users get clear feedback about why deletion failed!");
