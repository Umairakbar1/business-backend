// How to use the enhanced deletion endpoints:

console.log("Enhanced Business Deletion API:");
console.log("1. DELETE /api/admin/businesses/:businessId");
console.log("   - Deletes a single business with subscription cleanup");
console.log("   - Handles both business and boost subscriptions");
console.log("   - Uses database transactions for atomicity");

console.log("\n2. DELETE /api/admin/businesses/bulk-delete");
console.log("   - Deletes multiple businesses with subscription cleanup");
console.log("   - Handles bulk operations efficiently");
console.log("   - Provides detailed deletion summary");

console.log("\nKey features of the enhanced deletion:");

console.log("\n✅ Database Transaction Safety:");
console.log("- All operations are wrapped in database transactions");
console.log("- If any step fails, all changes are rolled back");
console.log("- Ensures data consistency and integrity");

console.log("\n✅ Complete Subscription Cleanup:");
console.log("- Deletes all subscriptions associated with the business");
console.log("- Handles both businessSubscriptionId and boostSubscriptionId");
console.log("- Cleans up any orphaned subscription references");

console.log("\n✅ Comprehensive Logging:");
console.log("- Logs all deletion steps for debugging");
console.log("- Provides detailed cleanup information");
console.log("- Tracks subscription IDs and deletion counts");

console.log("\n✅ Error Handling:");
console.log("- Validates business IDs before deletion");
console.log("- Handles specific error types (ValidationError, CastError)");
console.log("- Provides meaningful error messages");

console.log("\n✅ Detailed Response:");
console.log("- Returns information about what was deleted");
console.log("- Includes subscription cleanup details");
console.log("- Provides business information for confirmation");

console.log("\nExample usage in your frontend:");

console.log("\n// Single business deletion");
console.log("const response = await fetch('/api/admin/businesses/business_id', {");
console.log("  method: 'DELETE',");
console.log("  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token' }");
console.log("});");
console.log("const result = await response.json();");
console.log("console.log('Deleted subscriptions:', result.data.cleanupDetails.subscriptionsDeleted);");

console.log("\n// Bulk business deletion");
console.log("const response = await fetch('/api/admin/businesses/bulk-delete', {");
console.log("  method: 'DELETE',");
console.log("  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },");
console.log("  body: JSON.stringify({");
console.log("    businessIds: ['business_id_1', 'business_id_2', 'business_id_3']");
console.log("  })");
console.log("});");
console.log("const result = await response.json();");
console.log("console.log('Businesses deleted:', result.data.deletionSummary.businessesDeleted);");
console.log("console.log('Subscriptions deleted:', result.data.deletionSummary.subscriptionsDeleted);");

console.log("\nWhat gets cleaned up when deleting a business:");

console.log("\n1. Business Document:");
console.log("   - Complete business record is deleted");
console.log("   - All business fields and data are removed");

console.log("\n2. Subscription Documents:");
console.log("   - All subscriptions where business = businessId are deleted");
console.log("   - This includes both business and boost subscriptions");
console.log("   - Payment plan references are automatically handled");

console.log("\n3. Reference Cleanup:");
console.log("   - Any other businesses referencing the deleted subscription IDs");
console.log("   - businessSubscriptionId and boostSubscriptionId fields are unset");
console.log("   - Prevents orphaned references in the database");

console.log("\n4. Transaction Safety:");
console.log("   - All operations happen in a single transaction");
console.log("   - If any step fails, nothing is deleted");
console.log("   - Ensures database consistency");
